A minimalist and efficient computer science portfolio website built with vite, tailwind and Astro.

## �️ Tech Stack & Tools

* **[Motion One](https://motion.dev/)** - A tiny, high-performance animation library utilizing the native Web Animations API for smooth scroll-reveal effects.
* **[Pixelarticons](https://pixelarticons.com/)** - Retro, 8-bit aesthetic icons used for section headers and UI elements.
* **[Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/)** - Used via CDN for accurate, brand-colored vector logos in the Skills section.
* **Typography** - `@fontsource/geist-mono` for technical metadata alongside system sans-serif fonts for optimal readability.
